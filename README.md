# 🛍️ Mall Customers Data Analysis

A mini data analytics project using the **Mall Customers** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amisha0528/mall-customers-dataset).

This is part of my learning journey in Data Analytics using Python.

## About the Project

This project explores the Mall Customers dataset to uncover simple insights about customer behavior using data visualization.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data loading and manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization

---

## Visualizations

### 1. Number of Customers by Gender
A bar chart showing the count of male vs. female customers.

**Insight:** Female customers outnumber male customers, suggesting that malls tend to attract more female shoppers.

### 2. Average Spending Score by Annual Income
A line graph showing the average spending score across different annual income levels.

**Insight:** There is no clear relationship between annual income and spending score. Customers spend differently regardless of how much they earn, suggesting spending habits are driven by other factors like age or personal preference.
